        This process are based on Action observation Therapy (AOT), 
        AOT is a multi-sensory approach grounded in basic neuroscience 
        which involves somatosensory and cognitive rehabilitation by 
        activating the mirror-neural system(MNS) of the brain. Recent 
        literature has demonstrated how merely observing a specific action 
        activates the same cortical brain areas that are committed to that 
        motor function. This helps the planning of movement and neuroplasticity.

      <p1><b>Motor Imagery</b></p1>
      <p2>
        Motor Imagery is a cognitive process in which  subject imagines 
        that he performs a movement without performing the movement or 
        without even tensing the muscles. This process requires the conscious 
        activation of brain regions that are also involved in movement preparation 
        and execution, accompanied by a voluntary inhibition of the actual movement.

      <p1><b>Electrical Stimulation</b></p1>
      <p2>
        This technique applies small electrical charges to a muscle directly 
        to make its usual movement. In this setup, FES act alike biofeedback 
        to patientâ€™s body. Biofeedback is a technique that patient can learn 
        to control a muscle movement by creating a new neuro-pathway from brain 
        to target muscle. This feedback helps patient make subtle changes in their 
        body and generated a neuroplasticity in their brain.
